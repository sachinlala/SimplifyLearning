        description: "Merge Sort is a stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm invented by John von Neumann in 1945. It consistently performs in O(n log n) time complexity, making it one of the most predictable sorting algorithms. The algorithm works by recursively dividing the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorting them, and then merging them back together in the correct order.",
        steps: [
            "Divide: Split the array into two halves until each sub-array has at most one element",
            "Conquer: Recursively sort the left and right sub-arrays (base case: single elements are already sorted)",
            "Combine: Merge the two sorted sub-arrays back into one sorted array",
            "Repeat the merge process up the recursion tree until the entire array is sorted"
